# UrbanScanner
This app was my Master Thesis project. It allows you to create georeferenced Point Clouds with just an Android Phone. To accomplish this, the [Geospatial API](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial), as well as the [Depth API](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/depth) for ARCore were utilized. For details, check the thesis attached to this repository (`Masterarbeit_Schoenawa_Emil_554086_Angewandte_Informatik.pdf`, German only).

# Running the app
In order to run this app you need to configure an API key for the Geospatial API in a Google Cloud Project. You can then write `apiKey=[API-KEY]` into the `local.properties` file, replacing `[API-KEY]` with your API key.
